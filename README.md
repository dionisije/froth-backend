# froth-backend

## Tthe backend Froth server
### Background
The Froth concept is a music compilation collaboration that started in 1993 with a few shared mix-tapes.  By 2000 there were 13 mix-tapes available (to a select few) and the next phase launched with releases burned onto CD-R.  It continues to this day with the mix-tapes having evolved into Spotify playlists.
### Details
This project has been created to supercede the current [Froth web site](http://frothmusic.com) with a responsive SPA which currently runs custom code riddled with jQuery via a PHP server and mySQL database (yeah, I know).  This backend service is MongoDB based and will serve data to the (Froth frontend)[https://github.com/dionisije/froth-frontend].

Current status can be viewed on the (Froth Trello board)[https://trello.com/b/KcCEX7KJ/froth-app].
